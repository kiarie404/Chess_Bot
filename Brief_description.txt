This is a web based Chess AI bot.
It does not have true AI, or deep learning capabilities.
It entirely depends on the Minimax algorithm to find a suitable move.
It uses the alpha-beta algorithm to improve its efficiency.

You can adjust the depth of the AI move searching.
The deeper the search, the more of an intelligent move the AI makes.
However, more depth equals more computation time consumed. A double edged sword
